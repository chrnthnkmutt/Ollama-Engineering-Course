## Contents

* 2.1. Structured inputs and outputs (Will be available later)

* 2.2. LLM Orchestration (Will be available later)

* **R.1. Intro to LLM Reasoning**

  Examine AI reasoning’s strengths and limitations and explore whether LLM "thinking" truly mirrors human cognitive processes.

* **R.2. Inference-Time Compute**
  
  Make LLMs more effective with advanced orchestration techniques. Explore how to choose wisely between different approaches — using a larger model or a smaller one with a more sophisticated strategy.

* **R.3. Establishing non-linear reasoning capabilities**

  Understand how models like DeepSeek-R1 develop reasoning abilities. Take a closer look at the data collection and training strategies that shape their performance.
  
* **A.1. LLM Tools and Agents**

  Learn how LLMs use tools and function calling to extend their capabilities.

* **A.2. Agentic Orchestration**

  Advance past manual LLM orchestration and start designing AI-driven workflows.
